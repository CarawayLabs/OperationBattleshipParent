# Project Motivations
As a Product Manager, I want to accomplish several key things through this project. 

- Demonstrate my ability to articulate meaningful problems that are faced by people like me. 
- Show novel approaches to solving the job hunt problem using modern, bleeding edge technologies. 
- Demonstrate a jour of self mastery when refining new skills. 
- Have fun! Technology is cool and its really engaging to be able to build something in your free time.


## Technical skills that I intend to demonstrate:
- Various uses of Large Language Models
    - My first need from the LLM is to add structure and extract insights from a job posting. Because job descriptions come in MANY different formats and lengths, traditional development methods would require complex and hard to maintain string processing rules. Enter... Large Language Models!! 
    - We will also be using the LLM to help job applicants understand their strengths and weaknesses for jobs
- Prompt Engineering Techniques to solve different use cases
    - I'll be exploring zero shot and few shot techniques to get the LLM perform the role of an API and add the intended structure to the job posting data.
    - As I go deeper and add more capabilities to the system, I'll be researching established + emerging prompting techniques that 
- The creation of recomendation systems
    - At its very core, Operation Battleship is a Job Recomendation System. Neither in my professional life, nor work life have I built a recomendation system. I'm interested in learning more about this use of AI / ML. 
- Basic Architecture and system design.
    - I believe a good Product Manager is able to effectively deliver software because they possess a blend of skills. They have the ability to leverage their business knowledge to discover market problems that provide meaningful ROI to the business and present compelling, new value to end users. The Product Manager must also posess the skills to work with their technical team. Being fluent enough in technology ensures that a Product Manager is able to discuss tradeoffs with their team and properly represent their work during other conversations.  
- Database design
    - The very first thing I had to build for this project was the relational db. 
- Basic Cloud Infrastructure Deployment
    - Some of the processes within this application will be deployed locally in order to save on infrastructure spend. However, we must have some portions deployed to the cloud in order to interact with our users and 
    - Beyond the obvious requirement to have externally available services, I want to focus on this area in order to further grow my own skills. 
- Basic Python Skills
    - Lorum Ipsum
- Dash, Plotly
- Exploratory Data Analysis with MatPlog Lib and PyPlot
- Data Visualization using Google Looker Products
