# Purpose
We want to experiment with Streamlit and determine if it will be a good solution to easily build a lightweight WebUI that allows our user's to interact with the application and explore the data. Right now this is just an incomplete stub. More to come in the future. 


# Potential Future State:
We could build  several different streamlit dashboards that allow users to explore the data around the posted jobs. In order to drive readability and create a cohesive dashboards, we will be splitting the Streamlit Dashboard into multiple pages. 

- Analytics:
    - The job market as a whole
    - Product Manager jobs
    - AI Jobs
- Searching: 
    - Basic Search and Filter

- Recomendation: 
    - We might implement an interface in Streamlit that allows users to upload their resume into the Job Recomendation Engine.
