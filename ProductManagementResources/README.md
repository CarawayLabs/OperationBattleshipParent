# Operation Battleship Product Management Information
Half of the mostivation for this project is to showcase my technical skills and learn novel technologies in the AI / ML Space. The other identified need is to showcase my Product Manager skills. This folder and the associated links are intened to serve as a form of a "portfolio" for a PM. 

## My why:
**TLDR**; I want a simple project to serve as a representation of my skils as an AI Product Manager.

Just like many of my peers, I've spent time on an interview panel when considering new Product Managers to join my team. I've frequently found that it is hard to really know the skills and techniques that this particular candidate employs when doing their job. Writing a resume and interviewing is a very stressful process and it only gives a SMALL window into a specific candidate. Sometimes the quietest people do the best work, but that wasn't obvious during the interview with them. 

I also recognize that AI is the hottest thing on the block. There are many candidates applying for open positions and I wanted to separate myself from others. 

I wanted to find a valueable way that can give confidence about my AI skills and also my Product Management skills. While there are MANY ways this could be accomplished, I elected to start a project from scratch and show my thought process throough the entire journey. I'm executing in the role of Starup Founder, Product Manager and Developer all in one. 

I hypothesize that this will provide evidence of my adaptability, growth mindset and the hard skills that I bring to the table.
