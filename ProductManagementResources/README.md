# Operation Battleship Product Management Information
Operation Battleship is a project that is intended to showcase my Product Management skills, technical skills and also my ability to learn new domains quickly. This folder within the repository is intended to serve as a "portfolio" of my approach to Product Management. 

## My why:
**TLDR**; I want a simple project to serve as a representation of my skils as an AI Product Manager.

Just like many of my peers, I've spent time on an interview panel when considering new Product Managers to join my team. I've frequently found that it is hard to really know the skills and techniques that this particular candidate employs when doing their job. Writing a resume and interviewing is a very stressful process and it only gives a SMALL window into a specific candidate. Sometimes the quietest people do the best work, but that wasn't obvious during the interview with them. 

I also recognize that AI is the hottest thing on the block. There are many candidates applying for open positions and I wanted to separate myself from others. I wanted to find a valueable way that can give confidence about my AI skills and also my Product Management skills. While there are MANY ways this could be accomplished, I elected to start a project from scratch and show my thought process throough the entire journey. I'm executing in the role of Starup Founder, Product Manager and Developer all in one. 

I hypothesize that this will provide evidence of my adaptability, growth mindset and the hard skills that I bring to the table.

## Why did I pick CarawayLabs as a name to describe myself?
As professionals in High-Tech, we are knowledge workers and the most succesful of us will often embody a sense of curiosity and experiementation in their daily practice. "Caraway Labs" is a phrase the evokes feelings of discovery, unknown and pioneering. I don't operate with a sense of ego or entitlement in my life as that will reduce our ability to lead high-performing teams and squashes creative thinking. 


## Why did I pick this Product Name?
When we reflect upon the board game called, "Battleship" that we played as children, I recall a game filled with random chance and lack of strategy. You are left blindly guessing the location of your opponent's ships. "B1... C4...." You are left with feelings of frustration due to the nature of the game. Many shots that you take are a dudd. And even when you hit a target, you don't actually know the opportunity size. Is this a battleship? Or is this just a patrol boat? I've often felt that the typical job search has similar elements of guessing and random chance. How do you efficiently find where the jobs are? And even when you find some possible jobs, how can you prioritize which jobs are most relevant to you and represent the biggest opportunities for your career? Operation Battleship is intended to turn the tides in the job search. No longer is it a game of random chance for the job seeker. Using our inteligent sonar, we help our users pinpoint the best opportunities so that they can achieve career excellence and personal fulfillment. 

Enter... Operation Battleship! By providing the user more inteligent tools for their job search, we aim to become the sonar used in your job search. We can help find the best roles and also help users understand adjacent roles and companies too.
